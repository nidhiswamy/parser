# Top-down Recursive Descent Parser

This project originated as a programming assignment for one of my academic classes. However, fueled by a growing interest in developing a parser for a custom language of my creation, I've decided to elevate this project to new levels. My goal is to extend and enhance the initial steps taken during the assignment, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved. I am excited to evolve this project into a comprehensive exploration of parsing techniques and take it to the next level. Your contributions and feedback are welcome!

# Implementation

This parser uses Python's libraries to ensure efficient and quick regular expression checking and parsing
